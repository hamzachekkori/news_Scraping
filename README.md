# news_Scraping

With the following code that I spent 10 days looking for and discovering the world of web scraping that I did not know before and in thank you for this challenge with which I learned a lot I made several attempts to Code but I leave you this last one which remains the simplest and clearest for me I tried to follow the standards of the Python language while trying
to write the minimum number of lines of code
I know that this sample code that I send you does not reflect my skills in coding but represents my motivation to take up the challenge to seize the opportunity to spend an internship at your home I hope I am up to your expectations
